# Mid Sprint Review February 8th, 2024

At this point in the project we have been given the
source code, given a description of possible project
requirements, and set up our development environments.

The goals of this meeting are to:
- Verify we are all comfortable working within
  the development environment
- Ensure we are all added as collaborators in 
  the GitHub repository
- Review the code contribution process
- Create GitHub issues for the rest of the Sprint
- Share what we've learned about the codebase so
  far

Our plans moving forward are to:
- Work on assigned GitHub issues
- Set up a meeting with Professor Fletcher
  to flesh out the project requirements

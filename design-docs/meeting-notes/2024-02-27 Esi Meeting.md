# 2024-02-27 Esi Sync Meeting

## What we've been working on
- Paul has been working on the admin panel bulk user
creation from CSV. We showed Esi the UI he made for that.
- Ramsey has been working on the Leaderboard summary on the 
user dashboard. We showed Esi the "Top 3" leaderboard summary.
- Kyle has been working on the local database setup and copying
data from production. We demonstrated logging into a users 
profile who exists in the production database.

## Her feedback
- She thought we'd made good progress
- Wants us to continue working on
    - Admin panel individual and bulk user creation
    - Leaderboard summary (context summary)
- Kyle to start work on Chat system now that
local development setup is done
- We're focusing on her top priorities, which is good

## Timeline
- Esi wanted a timeline of when we think we'd have 
features done so she can estimate the scope of work
for the semester
- We told her that by mid March we will likely have:
    - The Leaderboard summary finished
    - The admin bulk user creation feature finished
    - The chat system will be in development or finished
- By the end of March we will evaluate our progress on
these items and decide either to polish them up further
or to move on to other new features

## Misc.
- Still waiting on Professor Fletcher for the move to Azure
    - This will allow us to send her staging builds of 
    in progress work

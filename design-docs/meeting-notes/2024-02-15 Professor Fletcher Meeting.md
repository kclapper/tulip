## Sprint Kickoff Meeting
### Agenda
- [ ] Review issues closed during the last sprint
- [ ] Review issues left open from last sprint
    - Remove from last sprint and possibly move to this sprint
- [ ] Review product requirements and add new issues as necessary
- [ ] Assign issues for this sprint

### Notes
- For PRs, instead of requiring reviews before merging them, perhaps
we should just request the reviews and then merge either when everyone
reviewed it or when after two days
    - We want to make sure changes are merged in a timely fashion so 
    everyone gets the enhancements

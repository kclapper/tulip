# Mid Sprint Review February 8th, 2024

At this point in the project we have been given the
source code, given a description of possible project
requirements, and set up our development environments.

The goals of this meeting are to:
- Verify we are all comfortable working within
  the development environment
- Ensure we are all added as collaborators in 
  the GitHub repository
- Review the code contribution process
- Create GitHub issues for the rest of the Sprint
- Share what we've learned about the codebase so
  far

Our plans moving forward are to:
- Work on assigned GitHub issues
- Set up a meeting with Professor Fletcher
  to flesh out the project requirements

## Meeting Notes
- Kyle explained how to setup the local development database
  and environment
  - There appeared to be a bug, he will fix and submit a PR
    tonight with a fix
- Paul pointed out that it would be better if the default
  environment was the `Development` environment
  - He pulled an issue for it that he will work on this sprint
- We decided on a git workflow
  - Everyone will work out of the repository `kclapper/tulip`
  - `main` is protected so that you can only add commits to 
    it through pull requrests
  - When everyone works on an issue, they'll create their own 
    branch and push it to the repository
  - When they're finished with that work, they submit a PR
  - The other two group members will review it. Just skimming
    the code, not an in-depth review
    - Purpose being to make sure we all understand what is changing
      in the codebase
  - Once a PR is approved, the person who opened it will do a squash 
    merge and delete their branch
- We reviewed open issues we can work on this week and assigned them
  to the group 
- We set up a "project" in GitHub to track our current and next sprints
